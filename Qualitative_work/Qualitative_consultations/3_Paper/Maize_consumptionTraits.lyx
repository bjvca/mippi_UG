\begin_layout Title
Tackling (mis)perceptions about the consumption-related traits of improved
 crop varieties: the case of cooking and tasting demonstrations in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
As part of a larger study on producer and consumer-side interventions for
 increasing adoption of improved crop varieties, we conducted a qualitative
 inquiry to learn about the consumption-related traits and consumer preferences
 for improved maize varieties in Uganda.
 This is an area with far less empirical work so far, since most studies
 evaluating strategies to promote agricultural technology adoption focus
 on traits and constraints on the producer side.
 Throguh a co-learning workshop and gender disaggregated focus group discussions
, we consulted thirty six maize consumers in Eastern Uganda on: (i) whether
 and how consumers can identify differences between maize varieties when
 they consume maize in different forms; (ii) what consumers consider as
 the most important maize consumption-related traists, and why these traits
 are important; (iii) the maize varieties in their communities that are
 most suitable in terms of the stated traits; and (iv) whether consumption-relat
ed traits influence farmers' choice of the maize variety to grow.
 We learned that maize is mainly consumed in the forms of posho meal, porridge,
 and whole maize (boiled or roasted), and that consumers can identify difference
s between varieties mainly through taste, color of the grain/flour, and
 size/weight of the grain.
 Maize consumption-related traits that are most important to consumers are
 palatability (sweet and smooth taste), grain size/weight (bigger/heavier
 grains produce more flour and also weigh more during selling), and flour
 productivity (ability of the flour to expand and produce more posho to
 feed more people).
 Using social network analysis, Bazooka maize variety emerged as the improved
 variety most suitable for these traits, followed by Longe 10H and Longe
 5.
 Finally, we find that farmers also consider consumption-related traits
 (mainly grain size/weight, milling-out-turn, and taste) when choosing a
 (new) maize variety to grow, although this is after ascertaining the yield
 potential.
 Maturity time of a variety is also important but mainly considered as a
 consumption-related trait because this ensures timely availability of maize
 for both food and income.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maize is an important crop in Uganda, prioritized by the Government as a
 key contributor to household/national food and income security.
 Unfortunately, current maize farm yields are far below (more than 60%)
 what is achievable.
 This is largely attributed to farmers' slow uptake of high yielding crop
 varieties, despite a diversity of such varieties on the market.

Research questions, data source, and analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The qualitative inquiry focused on answering four broad questions, namely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
whether and how consumers can identify differences between white maize varieties
 when they consume maize in different forms; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
what consumers consider as the most important maize consumption-related
 traists, and why these traits are important; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the maize varieties in their communities that are most suitable in terms

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
whether consumption-related traits influence farmers' choice of the maize
 variety to grow.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer these question, we consulted thirty six maize consumers (Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Category-and-sex"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), in Eastern Uganda, through a one-day co-learning workshop and gender
 disaggregated focus group discussions (FGDs).
 The consumers we consulted were purposively selected; to represent individuals
 that are aware of and/or knowledgeable about maize consumption traits through
 consuming maize, but also based on their different roles/experieces in
 the maize value chain as maize breeders/reesearch, extension staff (district
 technical staff), maize seed distributors, maize farmers, maize traders,
 and maize processors/millers.
 For instance, maize millers, besides being consumers, may be more knowledgeable
 about the maize varieties that produce more/best flour when milled.
 Likewise, farmers may be more knowledgeable about the varieties that have
 a longer shelf life or mature faster than other maize consumers.
 Fifty three percent of the consumers we consulted are women.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The workshop had nineteen maize consumer participants, and was held prior
 to the FGDs.
 We conducted four FGDs in the communities, to follow-up on the key feedback
 from the workshop.
 Two of the FGDs consisted of men and women, interviewed separately.
 The third and fourth FGDs were mixed (both men and women), of which, one
 consisted only a couple (husband and wife).
 The number of FGD participants ranged between two (couple) to six.
 A gender focus during the FGD discussion was important, especially after
 learning from the workshop that men and women are aware of, and seemingly
 prefer different maize consumption-related traits.
 We also learnt from the workshop that men and women are involved in different
 activities of the maize consumption processâ€” for instance, women do more
 of the cooking, while men are more responsible for taking maize for milling.

\begin_layout Standard
In both the workshop and the FGDs, the participants were first provided
 with information about the study (objectives, research questions, study
 sites, the implementing organization, and the study design) under which
 the consultations were taking place.
 For the workshop, the study information was followed by a group work session
 where the participants split into identical groups to answer a set of nine
 maize consumption-related questions.
 Before the groups answered the questions, the workshop faciltator went
 through all questions to ensure that all the participants had a common
 understanding.
 After the questions were answered, each group's answers were presented
 and jointly discussed.
 The FGD were more specific, focusing mainly on the key elements from the
 workshp.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data analysis to answer research questions 1, 2, and 4 was conducted in
 excel to generate bar charts and tables showing percentage of responses.
 The responses were weighted based on the number of participants in each
 workshop group or FGD group.
 For research question 3, data were analyzed using the network analysis
 approach in the R 4.2.2.
 statistical tool.

Results and discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How do maize consumers identify and differentiate between maize varieties
 during consumption?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To gain insights into whether and how consumers differentiate between maize
 varieties, we first asked the respondents about the most common forms in
 which they and similar households in their communities consume maize.
 We learnt that maize is mainly consumed in the forms of maize meal (or
 posho as it is commonly known in Uganda), followed by porridge, and whole
 maize (either boiled or roasted).
 Maize flour is the main ingregient used to prepare both posho and porridge,
 hence maize is an important crop.
 While there are slight variations in the preparation of posho (depending
 on whether one prefers it relatively hard or soft), the most common method
 involves cooking water to a boiling point, then adding flour in portions
 while mingling it to a dough-like consistency when ready.
 The preparation of porridge follows a similar process but involves mixing
 the flour with cold water before adding to the boiling water, and stirring
 until ready.
 Feedback from the consultations indicate that maize porridge is mainly
 consumed by children and babies, and as such, women prefer to make porridge
 using the less refined maize flour that is more tasty and considered more
 nutritious.
 However, for posho, the less refined maize flour is not preferred because
 the resulting posho meal bears a rough-sore taste, and this type of flour
 has a short shelf life.
 Maize meal and porridge are also the most consumed foods in public institutions
 like schools and prisons.
 Whole maize (either boiled or roasted) is increasingly becoming a common
 road-side snack prepared and sold to workers returning from office in the
 evening.
