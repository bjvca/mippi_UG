\begin_layout Title
Do consumer perceptions about local and improved crop varieties align with

Study hypothesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Improved maize varieties are perceived to possess less favorable consumption
 related-traits compared to local varieties (conduct ttests on votes before
 the cooking and tasting demos)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In reality, improved crop varieties may possess the same or even better
 consumption related traits as local varieties (conduct ttests on votes
 after the cooking and tasting demos)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is no difference in the way men and women perceive the consumption-related
 traits of improved maize varieties (use ttests, and regressions— conditional
 means and psmatch)

\begin_layout Subsection
Data source and sample
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Qualitative data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The qualitative inquiry focused on answering two broad questions, namely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
whether and how consumers can identify differences between white maize varieties
 when they consume maize in different forms; and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
what consumers consider as the most important maize consumption-related
 traists, and why these traits are important;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer these question, we consulted thirty six maize consumers (Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Category-and-sex-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), in Eastern Uganda, through a one-day co-learning workshop and gender
 disaggregated focus group discussions (FGDs).
 The consumers we consulted were purposively selected; to represent individuals
 that are aware of and/or knowledgeable about maize consumption traits through
 consuming maize, but also based on their different roles/experieces in
 the maize value chain as maize breeders/reesearchers, extension staff (district
 technical staff), maize seed distributors, maize farmers, maize traders,
 and maize processors/millers.
 For instance, maize millers, besides being consumers, may be more knowledgeable
 about the maize varieties that produce more/best quality flour when milled.
 Likewise, farmers may be more knowledgeable about the varieties that have
 a longer shelf life or mature faster than other maize consumers.
 Fifty three percent of the consumers we consulted are women.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The workshop had nineteen maize consumer participants, and was held prior
 to the FGDs.
 As a follow-up on the main findings from the workshop, we conducted four
 FGDs in the communities.
 Two of the FGDs consisted of men and women, interviewed separately.
 The third and fourth FGDs were mixed (both men and women), of which, one
 consisted only a couple (husband and wife).
 The number of FGD participants ranged between two (couple) to six.
 A gender focus during the FGD discussion was important, especially after
 learning from the workshop that men and women are aware of, and seemingly
 prefer different maize consumption-related traits.
 We also learnt from the workshop that men and women are involved in different
 activities of the maize consumption process— for instance, women do more
 of the cooking, while men are more responsible for taking maize for milling.

\begin_layout Subsection
Learning about the consumption-related traits of maize
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Maize dishes most commonly eated by households in Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To gain insights into whether and how consumers differentiate between maize
 varieties, we first asked the respondents about the most common forms in
 which they and similar households in their communities consume maize.
 We learnt that maize is mainly consumed in the forms of maize meal (or
 posho as it is commonly known in Uganda), followed by porridge, and whole
 maize (either boiled or roasted).
 Maize flour is the main ingregient used to prepare both posho and porridge,
 hence maize is an important crop.
 While there are slight variations in the preparation of posho (depending
 on whether one prefers it relatively hard or soft), the most common method
 involves cooking water to a boiling point, then adding flour in portions
 while mingling it to a dough-like consistency when ready.
 The preparation of porridge follows a similar process but involves mixing
 the flour with cold water before adding to the boiling water, and stirring
 until ready.
 Feedback from the consultations indicate that maize porridge is mainly
 consumed by children and babies, and as such, women prefer to make porridge
 using the less refined maize flour that is more tasty and considered more
 nutritious.
 However, for posho, the less refined maize flour is not preferred because
 the resulting posho meal bears a rough-sore taste, and this type of flour
 has a short shelf life.
 Maize meal and porridge are also the most consumed foods in public institutions
 like schools and prisons.
