Experimental Evidence from Seed Trial Packs in Ethiopia and Uganda
\size default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Free samples or temporary price reductions are a widely used strategy to introduce new products or technologies,
 offering prospective users the opportunity to gain firsthand experience and potentially facilitate diffusion through social networks.
 However,
 concerns remain that subsidizing or giving away products may reduce their perceived value,
 increasing the risk that recipients will under-utilize,
 re-purpose,
 or resell the product rather than use it for its intended purpose.
 We examine three mechanisms through which charging a positive price may increase uptake,
 intended use and subsequent adoption of a new technology:
 (1) a screening effect,
 whereby payment deters users who do not value the product and targets those more likely to use it;
 (2) a sunk cost effect,
 where paying a positive price induces a psychological commitment to use;
 and (3) a quality signaling effect,
 where a positive price conveys higher product quality.
 We test the relevance of these mechanisms in explaining demand for seed of recently released varieties of staple food crops,
 drawing on a field experiment with smallholder farmers in Uganda and Ethiopia.
 We find that willingness to pay is a reliable predictor of subsequent use of seed trial packs,
 pointing to the value of modest prices for targeting likely adopters.
 At the same time,
 sunk cost effects are largely absent or even negative,
 suggesting that charging farmers can tighten liquidity and reduce their ability or willingness to experiment.
 These findings carry important implications for how pricing strategies can be designed to promote technology adoption in low-income settings.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prices are ubiquitous in economic transactions.
 They are central to the efficient allocation of scarce resources within a society and provide important supply-side incentives.
 But charging the (full) price may not always be optimal.
 For instance,
 if a product or technology is new,
 providing it for free or at a discount for a short period of time may be necessary to encourage potential users to try it and learn from it

 From a social welfare point of view,
 subsidies may be justified to ensure access to essential goods and services for poor or disadvantaged communities that may benefit most

\begin_layout Plain Layout

citep{duflo2011poor}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Additionally,
 providing an initial initial bundle of subsidized goods or services can help overcome barriers to adoption by giving a temporary boost that enables reinvestment and sustained use over time,
 potentially setting off a path to long-term welfare gains,
 in a process reminiscent of the dynamics described in the poverty trap literature 
\begin_inset ERT

citep{10.1093/qje/qjab045}

\end_inset

.
 More broadly,
 from a policy perspective,
 in the early stages of market development,
 public subsidies can play a catalytic role by stimulating initial demand for promising technologies or services,
 helping them reach a critical mass of users that enables economies of scale and attracts sustained private sector engagement.
 Finally,
 the presence of positive externalities provides another strong rationale against charging the full price for socially beneficial goods and services

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time,
 there are concerns that free or subsidized provision of goods and services may diminish their perceived value among recipients.
 As a result,
 these free or subsidized goods are sometimes left unused,
 repurposed,
 or even resold.
 Prominent examples include the use of free bed nets for fishing and the diversion of subsidized chlorine from water treatment to household cleaning

There are at least three mechanisms through which charging a positive price for a good or service may increase its uptake and use.
 First,
 a

 effect may arise:
 individuals who place a higher intrinsic value on the product are more likely to be willing to pay for it,
 leading to better targeting of actual users.
 Second,
 a

\end_inset

 effect refers to a psychological commitment whereby individuals are more likely to value and use a product simply because they have incurred a cost to obtain it,
 regardless of its objective utility

 Third,
 prices can act as

 of quality,
 particularly in contexts of uncertainty and asymmetric information,
 where consumers may infer higher quality from higher prices,

\begin_layout Standard
A key challenge is that these mechanisms are typically conflated in observational data,
 as each mechanism implies a positive correlation between price and use.

 who employ a two-stage pricing design in which commodities are first offered at randomized prices and then subject to a surprise discount to disentangle screening and sunk cost effects,
 we extend the design with a third stage to also isolate signaling effects.
 Specifically,
 in the first stage,
 farmers receive an initial randomized offer price that provides a potential quality signal.
 In the second stage,
 a bargaining game elicits willingness to pay,
 which allows us to identify screening effects.
 In the third stage,
 a surprise discount is introduced,
 enabling us to measure sunk cost effects.
 The contribution of each mechanism can then be estimated through regression analysis:
 To identify the screening effect,
 we focus on the marginal effect of willingness to pay while controlling for the initial randomized offer price and the transaction price (that is,
 the price that was actually paid for the good or service,
 after the surprise discount was applied).
 To test for sunk cost effects,
 we examine the effect of the transaction price while controlling for willingness to pay and the initial offer price.
 Finally,
 to capture signaling effects,
 we assess the impact of the initial randomized offer price while holding constant both willingness to pay and the transaction price.

\begin_layout Standard
We apply our experiment in the context of seed trial packs distributed to smallholder farmers in a developing-country setting with the aim of promoting the use of recently introduced improved seed varieties.
 Studying how pricing may affect adoption and use of such agricultural technologies presents a policy-relevant case for several reasons.
 First,
 given the novelty of and limited familiarity with a new variety,
 trial packs may be necessary to encourage experimentation among risk-averse farmers

\end_layout

.
 Second,
 social learning,
 especially through peer networks,
 plays a critical role in the large-scale adoption of new agricultural technologies,
 suggesting the existence of significant positive externalities

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Third,
 seed purchases involve non-trivial upfront costs,
 making them susceptible to sunk cost effects.
 Finally,
 seed markets are often plagued by significant information asymmetries regarding product quality,
 which adds an additional layer of risk to farmer investment decisions

 provide evidence that agro-input dealers actively use signaling to counter these asymmetries and build trust with buyers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment was implemented for teff and wheat in Ethiopia (about 650 and 430 smallholder farmers,
 respectively),
 and maize in Uganda (about 760 smallholder farmers).
 To assess how pricing of improved seed varieties affects outcomes along the adoption pathway,
 we collected detailed data in two rounds:
 in the short run (the first season after distribution) we tracked whether the seed trial pack was planted,
 whether seed and harvest were kept separate,
 and who in the household used it;
 in the longer run (the subsequent season) we measured adoption of improved and promoted varieties,
 plot-level production and productivity,
 and use of complementary inputs such as fertilizer and chemicals.
 This dual focus enables us to go beyond the immediate use of the trial pack,
 which most studies stop at,
 and examine subsequent adoption and complementary investment decisions that are rarely captured in this literature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that willingness to pay for seed trial packs is a strong predictor of whether farmers use and later adopt the promoted variety,
 indicating a clear screening effect.
 By contrast,
 paying for the seed does not generally increase use through sunk cost mechanisms;
 in some cases,
 payment even reduces use.
 The fact that this negative effect extends to complementary input use points to liquidity constraints limiting farmersâ ability to experiment.
 We also find no consistent evidence of a signaling effect.
 Taken together,
 these results suggest that modest positive prices can help target likely adopters without discouraging use,
 provided they remain low enough to avoid negative sunk cost (and in some markets negative signaling effects).
 However,
 pricing alone is unlikely to secure longer-term outcomes such as sustained technology adoption.

Liesbet:
 I am not sure I got the conclusion here.
 Finding a positive sunk cost effect would be good and a reason not too have prices too low (as people would not put enough effort if they did not pay enough/got it for free?),
 hence finding no sunk cost effect rather means that subsidizing can be done,
 without risking a reduction in effort made?
 On signaling:
 any idea where the surprising negative comes from?
 It is too high prices (irrealistic,
 hence lowering trust?).
 Maybe we should be careful with concluding more generally that prices may not be too high because that would result in negatively?

\begin_layout Standard
Our study contributes to a growing literature that examines how pricing affects the uptake and adoption of goods and services,
 particularly in contexts where such goods generate positive externalities.
 A central question in this literature is whether charging a positive price enhances usersâ valuation and proper use of the good or service,
 or whether providing goods for free or at a subsidy instead leads to underutilization,
 repurposing,
 or outright wastage.
 This tension is especially salient in the design of public health and agricultural interventions,
 where concerns about cost recovery,
 wastage,
 and behavioral responses to subsidies often shape policy.

 employs a two-stage pricing design to study improved agricultural technology adoption in Bangladesh,
 with a distinct objective:
 to test whether prices can effectively screen farmers based on their expected returns to the technology and thus preventing subsidized inputs from reaching farmers with low potential gains.
 She finds that buyers do not systematically achieve higher returns than non-buyers,
 raising concerns about the efficiency of using price as a targeting mechanism for agricultural innovations.
 Other work has explored whether free distribution leads to misuse or resale.

 also studying bed nets in Kenya,
 find little external leakage and no evidence that poor households resell freely distributed nets.
 Their findings support the viability of targeted free distribution,
 challenging the notion that zero prices necessarily erode product value or responsible use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study builds on this body of work but adds a critical innovation by explicitly isolating and testing signaling effects as a third mechanism alongside the more commonly studied screening and sunk cost effects.
 Existing two-stage pricing designs typically examine whether prices screen for users with higher private valuations or induce sunk cost-driven commitment,
 typically by estimating one effect while controlling for the other.

 but their design primarily focuses on disentangling screening from sunk cost effects.}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However,
 if prices also signal quality in contexts with information asymmetries,
 then ignoring this channel may confound estimates of screening effects.
 To address this limitation,
 we introduce our novel three-stage pricing design,
 allowing us to separately identify the three effects by randomizing initial offer price (signaling),
 using a bargaining game to elicit willingness to pay (screening),
 and assigning a surprise discount to a randomly selected subsample of participants (to assess sunk cost effects).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second contribution is the multi-country,
 multi-commodity context,
 which strengthens both the external validity and practical relevance of our findings.
 We implement the same experimental design in Uganda and Ethiopia,
 two countries that differ in agro-ecological conditions,
 seed market structures,
 and policy environments,
 allowing us to assess the generalizability of price effects across institutional and agronomic settings.
 Importantly,
 these contextual differences also speak to the relative importance of the three mechanisms.
 For instance,
 signaling effects may be particularly relevant in Uganda,
 where persistent concerns about counterfeit and low-quality seed in the supply chain undermine farmersâ trust in new varieties 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

citep{BARRIGA2020104928}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Heterogeneity across crops provides a plausible rationale for the differential importance of screening and sunk cost effects as well.
 For teff in Ethiopia,
 a traditional staple characterized by wide variation in farmer familiarity and preferences for local seed,
 screening mechanisms are likely to be particularly relevant:
 willingness to pay may effectively sort farmers according to expected returns and willingness to experiment.
 By contrast,
 for wheat,
 which is more commercialized and closely linked to market-oriented production decisions,
 sunk cost effects may play a larger role,
 as expenditures on seed are perceived as an investment that reinforces the commitment to plant and manage the crop.
 By spanning three distinct cropsâ
maize in Uganda,
 teff and wheat in Ethiopiaâ
we are thus able to explore how the strength of screening,
 sunk cost,
 and signaling effects varies with baseline knowledge,
 perceived quality uncertainty,
 and crop-specific value propositions.
 This cross-context approach provides nuanced insights into how pricing strategies should be tailored to different markets and technologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
 We first explain the methods used and the experimental design,
 followed by the estimation strategy.
 We then turn to sampling and provide descriptive statistics of our study population.
 The analysis consists of two parts.
 We first look at the price elasticity of demand for the seed trial packs using willingness-to-pay data to analyze the overall effects of charging positive prices for a new technology.
 We then provide estimates for screening,
 sunk cost,
 and signaling effects.
 The last section concludes and reflects on implications for policy.

 In a two-stage pricing design,
 the first stage involves randomizing the posted price of a product across participants or sites,
 generating variation in who initially decides to purchase.
 This allows researchers to test for screening effects,
 since willingness to buy at a given posted price may correlate with expected use.
 In the second stage,
 among those who agreed to purchase at the posted price,
 a subset is randomly offered an unanticipated discount or rebate that lowers the actual transaction price.
 Because all of these individuals revealed a willingness to pay the original posted price,
 any systematic difference in subsequent usage between those who ultimately pay more versus less can be attributed to sunk cost effects,
 rather than to differences in underlying demand.
 Together,
 this two-stage design cleanly separates selection at the offer stage from psychological responses to the act of paying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We build on the standard two-stage pricing design by introducing an additional stage at the beginning,

The experiment begins with a scripted bilateral bargaining game involving concessional offers.
 In particular,
 farmers are given the opportunity to purchase a bag of seed from a trained enumerator instructed to simulate typical bargaining interactions,

 in the first stage,
 participants are typically offered a good at randomly assigned price points.
 A common drawback of this approach is that a substantial share of participants opt not to purchase the good,
 which,
 absent over-subscription,
 can significantly reduce the effective sample size.
 Since willingness to pay (WTP) is central to analyzing two-stage pricing designs,
 alternative elicitation methods like the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanism can be employed to mitigate this problem to some extent.
 In its basic form,
 BDM asks participants to state a bid,
 which is then compared to a randomly drawn price.
 If the bid is lower,
 participants do not receive the product;
 if it meets or exceeds the price,
 participants purchase the product at the drawn price.
 A key advantage of this method is that it inherently includes a surprise discount for those whose WTP exceeds the random price---mimicking the second stage in two-stage pricing designs---see appendix E in 
\backslash
citet{doi:10.1086/705374}.
 While we initially planned to elicit WTP using a BDM mechanism,
 field testing revealed that farmers were confused by the one-shot nature of the transaction.
 As a result,
 we opted for a bargaining game that more closely reflected farmers' real-world experience with price negotiation.
 This design change led us to update the

 prices ranged from 65 to 110 Ethiopian birr (ETB) for 2 kg of teff (with increments of ETB 5) and from ETB 50 to ETB 80 for a 3 kg wheat seed pack (increments of ETB 10).}

The enumerator explains what kind of variety it is and what the advantages are.
 The farmer has the option to accept the bag of seed at this initial offer price or not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the farmer does not accept the initial offer price,
 the farmer enters into a bargaining stage where he or she is encouraged to name their first counter bid price.
 A computer algorithm then determines a counter-offer that the enumerator asks in a second round of negotiation.
 This new ask price is determined as the farmer's bid price plus 80 percent of the difference between the (initial) ask price and the farmer's bid price (appropriately rounded depending on the crop).
 This updated (lower) ask price is then compared to the bid price of the farmer.
 If the price difference between the bid and (updated) ask price is smaller than a (crop specific) threshold,
 the ODK script instructs the enumerator to sell at the price the farmer bids.
 If the difference between the updated ask price and the bid price is larger than the threshold,
 the updated ask price is presented to the farmer,
 and the farmer gets a second opportunity to accept or reject.
 If the farmer does not accept,
 he or she is encouraged to make a second bid and a third ask price is determined as the farmer's last bid price plus 80 percent of the difference between the last ask price and the farmer's last bid price.
 Bargaining continues until the farmer accepts an ask price,
 or the price difference between the last bid and last ask price is smaller than a (crop specific) threshold.

After the bargaining experiment,
 we administered a baseline survey and,
 near the end of the interaction,
 offered a randomly selected subgroup of farmers a surprise discount.
 Unlike most two-stage pricing designs that introduce random or tiered discounts (typically to estimate demand curves or identify optimal subsidy levels),
 we employ a single,
 full (100%) discount.
 This decision is guided by three considerations.
 First,
 we anticipate a behavioral discontinuity between paying any positive amount and receiving the good for free,
 consistent with findings in behavioral economics that zero prices can have a disproportionate impact on uptake and use 
\begin_inset ERT

citep[eg.][]{shampanier2007zero}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Second,
 concentrating the sample in two distinct groups (those who pay and those who receive the good for free) increases statistical power relative to designs that distribute observations across multiple price points.
 Third,
 by replicating how new agricultural technologies are often introduced in practice,
 with free sample packs provided to encourage trial and learning,
 our approach strengthens the external validity of the study.

 may serve as a signal of quality.

 based on which screening may occur.
 Third,
 the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
emph{transaction price}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 refers to the actual amount the farmer pays for the seed,
 which is either zero (if assigned to receive the full discount,
 in which case there would be no sunk cost effect) or equal to the WTP price (if no discount is given).
 We will assess how these prices influence farmersâ use of the trial pack,
 their adoption of the seed variety that the trial pack promotes in the following season,
 and their use of complementary inputs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seed trial packs include 1 to 3 kilograms of seed of an improved variety depending on the crop (1 kg of maize,
 2 kg of teff,
 and 3 kg of wheat).
 For the Ugandan case,
 we use a recently introduced hybrid variety popularly known as Bazooka,
 produced by Naseco Seed Ltd.
 The seed is high yielding.
 It promises between 3.5 and 4 metric tons per acre and was partly chosen because it is widely available on the market.
 The 1 kg bag of maize seed is enough to plant about one-eighth of an acre.
 For the Ethiopian case,
 we provide trial packs for three recently released teff varieties (Eba,
 Bora,
 and Boset) and one widely available wheat variety (Daka).
 The seeds were selected based on suitability to the agroecological conditions of our study areas and yield potential compared to standard varieties.
 A 2 kg bag of teff seed is sufficient to plant about half an acre,
 while a 3 kg bag of wheat seed covers only about one tenth of an acre.
 Although wheat is sown more densely than teff,
 farmers in Ethiopia also devote much smaller areas to wheat compared to teff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our study sample constitutes 10 farmers per village from 76 villages in Uganda and 16 farmers per village from 68 villages in Ethiopia.
 These numbers were chosen to balance logistical feasibility with statistical power considerations.
 In both countries,
 assignment to surprise discounts was randomized at the village/kebele level,
 as we wanted to avoid that a farmer receiving a bag of seed for free would have close interactions with farmers paying a positive price for the same trial pack.
 However,
 we did vary the initial offer price in the bargaining experiment at the individual level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To separate the three different effects,
 we estimate models that are similar to the original two-stage design used in for instance 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
citet{10.1257/aer.100.5.2383}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Recall that in two-stage designs,
 study participants are given the opportunity to buy a commodity at different price points and in a second stage are given a surprise discount (also leading to a

 and 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 similar to our set-up).
 In such designs,
 the outcome variable of interest (for example,
 an indicator for whether the seed was used as intended) is regressed on both the WTP price and the transaction price.
 A statistically significant and positive coefficient on the WTP price,
 controlling for the transaction price,
 provides evidence of a screening effect,
 since it reflects the positive relationship between the participantâs valuation and the outcome of interest,
 irrespective of whether the full price was paid or not.
 A significant and positive coefficient on the transaction price,
 controlling for the WTP price,
 indicates a sunk cost effect,
 where paying a higher price increases commitment to using the product,
 irrespective of the farmer's valuation of the product.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our analysis,
 we have three sets of prices and so the outcome variable of interest is regressed on the WTP price,
 the transaction price,
 and the initial offer price:

Sample and Descriptive Statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Uganda case study,
 the total sample consists of a representative sample of about 760 maize farming households,
 drawn from 4 districts in Eastern Uganda (Mayuge,
 Kamuli,
 Iganga,
 and Bugiri).
 These districts were chosen because maize is an important crop for both food and cash.
 In these 4 districts,
 76 villages were randomly selected from a list of all villages with the likelihood of a village being selected proportional to the number of households that live in the village.
 Within each village,
 10 households were randomly selected.
 In Ethiopia,
 we sampled 1,000 farming households from 70 kebeles across 10 districts in the Amhara region:
 Borena/Debresina,
 Ebinat,
 Enbese Sar Midir,
 Jama,
 Kelela,
 Libokemkem,
 Sayint,
 Shebel Berenta,
 Tenta,
 and Werellu.
 Within each kebele,
 16 households were randomly selected.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Uganda,
 in February and March 2023,
 well before the first agricultural season,
 trained enumerators visited all sampled households and collected baseline data.
 At that time,
 farmers were also provided with the seed trial pack.
 A few days before enumerators would visit the villages to collect baseline data and implement the bargaining exercise,
 farmers were notified that we would visit them,
 and they were told that there may be an opportunity to buy something so they should make sure they had a little bit of money by the time we visited them.
 Baseline data in Ethiopia was collected in August 2022 by trained enumerators with a minimum of three years of field experience.
 In May 2023,
 a subset of these enumerators received two days of training to implement the experiment,
 following a standardized protocol consisting of introduction,
 informed consent,
 the bargaining exercise,
 and treatment delivery.

 the baseline survey was implemented after the experiment ended and seed and money changed hands.

 to avoid influencing farmers' responses to the baseline survey.}

 Endline surveys were conducted in February 2024 in Uganda and in November 2024 in Ethiopia to capture use of the seed trial pack,

 presents baseline characteristics for the three samples (Uganda maize,
 Ethiopia teff and Ethiopia wheat),
 revealing some interesting cross-country differences.
 Ugandan household heads tend to be older,
 averaging nearly 50 years,
 compared to about 45 years in the Ethiopian sites.
 Educational attainment also differs sharply:
 while nearly half of Ugandan household heads have completed primary school,
 this is true for only about 20 percent of their Ethiopian counterparts.
 Households in Ethiopia are more likely to be male-headed than those in Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demographic patterns further highlight Ugandaâs rapid population growth.
 The average household in the Ugandan sample is over eight members,
 compared to just five in Ethiopia.
 Ugandan farmers report living around 4 kilometers from the nearest agro-dealer,
 suggesting a relatively dense input supply network.
 Unfortunately,
 comparable data on input access were not collected in Ethiopia.

While the first five characteristics are expected to be unaffected by our intervention,
 we also report five baseline variables that are more likely to change as a result of the study.
 To begin,
 we include a broad measure of technology adoption by asking whether farmers had used seed of an improved variety for the relevant crop on any plot during the season prior to the baseline.
 In Uganda,
 about 41 percent reported using improved maize varieties

Liesbeth:
 Should we make description consistent with table.
 'Quality seed' in table is a bit vague?
 Coudl we say "Used improved seed on at least one plot" and "Used promoted (or distributed) improved seed variety on the randomly selected plat" --> that might make clear that in both cases this is about improved seeds,
 but second question is about the specific variety used in the experiment,
 on the specific plot.
\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 whereas improved seed adoption in Ethiopia was considerably lower,
 at just 18 to 19 percent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To capture uptake of the specific varieties promoted in our study,
 we took a more targeted approach.
 Farmers were asked to list all plots on which the relevant crop was grown,
 after which one plot was randomly selected for detailed follow-up questions.

 As the plot to be surveyed was selected randomly,
 outcomes should be unbiased and consistent.

 In Uganda,
 only around 6 percent of farmers had already planted the promoted maize variety,
 Bazooka,
 in the preceding season.
 In Ethiopia,
 uptake of the promoted teff and wheat variety was similarly low,
 with less than 6 percent reporting prior use.
 These figures underscore that the technologies introduced in the study had not yet gained traction at scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
About 35 percent of farmers in Uganda used maize seed from a formal seed source in the season preceding the baseline (for instance

 from an agro-input dealer or the government extension system).
 This share is substantially lower in the Ethiopian sample.
 To maintain sufficient vigor,
 seed should not be recycled too often.
 In Uganda,
 fewer than 20 percent of maize farmers used seed that had been recycled fewer than five times,
 which is generally considered the upper limit for open-pollinated varieties.
 We did not collect comparable information on seed recycling in Ethiopia.
 Finally,
 average maize yields on the randomly selected plot in the season preceding the intervention were around 400 kilograms per acre in Uganda.

Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Price elasticity of demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first step in the analysis is to assess whether demand for the seed is responsive to price,
 as some degree of price sensitivity is needed for screening,
 sunk cost and signaling effects to manifest in subsequent use of the good or service.

 price elasticity of demand also affects how an increase in prices might limit seed purchases

Liesbeth:
 ?
 Note sure,
 but negative price elasticity does not necessarily mean a problem of access?
 And adoption of seed might also not be the right term,

 But maybe I did not get what you meant here.

,
 even in the absence of mechanisms such as screening,
 sunk cost,
 or signaling effects that affect actual use of the seed.
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
footnote{It is important to see the subtle but crucial distinction between price elasticity on the one hand and the three effects---and the screening effect in particular---on the other hand.
 Price elasticity of demand captures how the number of farmers who purchase the seed changes as its price increases.
 The screening effect,
 by contrast,
 is not about who purchases the seed,
 but about how the seed is used:
 it examines whether those who pay higher prices are more likely to actually plant the seed,
 because they tend to be farmers with higher expected returns or stronger motivation.
 While screening requires that demand is at least somewhat price-sensitive (so that not everyone buys at every price),
 the key distinction is that elasticity tells us how many farmers buy the seed,
 whereas screening tells us how those who buy it differ in how they use it.}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In settings where farmers face cash or credit constraints,
 this may disproportionately exclude those who could potentially benefit most from the technology.
 In that sense,
 high price elasticity is often cited as a key justification for providing subsidies.

 In all three panels,
 we observe a clear negative relationship between price and the share of farmers who agree to purchase the seed,
 consistent with downward-sloping demand curves.
 For both maize and teff seed,
 uptake declines steadily as the price increases,
 indicating relatively high price sensitivity.
 The pattern is somewhat less smooth for wheat,
 where demand remains flat between 40 and 50 birr before dropping off at higher price points,
 but the overall trend is still downward.
 These patterns confirm that farmers respond to price variation in a way that is consistent with economic theory,
 and that demand for seed is indeed price-sensitive---a necessary condition for mechanisms like screening,
 sunk cost,
 and signaling effects to operate.

 Indeed,
 the primary outcome in studies that look at the relative importance of screening and sunk cost effects is whether the product that was subsidized or provided for free was used for its intended purpose and not wasted,
 diverted or sold.
 Our first outcome variable is thus whether the seed trial pack was planted in the season that immediately followed the distribution of the seed trial packs.

 Doing so,
 we find evidence of a significant screening effect:
 farmers with higher valuations of the seed,
 as proxied by the final price agreed upon during the bargaining game,
 are also more likely to have planted it.
 Results further show no evidence of a sunk cost effect on seed trial pack use:
 farmers who paid a positive price were no more likely to plant the seed than those with a surprise offer who received it for free
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Liesbeth:
 Here you seem to interpret it as if it were a dummy.
 Did I get correctly that it is not a dummy,
 but transaction price?
 If so,
 also within half the sample there is variation in transaction prices that may be captured (a linear sunk cost effect) but attenuate the (largely larger) effect of the random (0/1) surprise?
\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 suggesting that paying for the technology does not increase farmers' psychological commitment to use it.
 Finally,
 a higher starting price at which the seed was initially offered reduces the likelihood that the seed is used for its intended purpose,
 suggesting a negative signaling effect.
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Liesbeth:
 Do we have insights on how consistent this effect is across price levels?
 I guess sample may not allow for it,
 but in case:
 if you see what farmers actually paid as compared to initial ask prices,
 then the highest ask prices are considerably above the highest WTP,
 so it might not have been a credible quality signal and rather have created distrust (hence negative coefficient)?
 On the other hand,
 for prices within the more plausible range,
 there could still have been a quality signal.
 I.e.
 are results on the signaling different for the upper/mid/lower ranges of initial prices?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A plausible explanation for this unanticipated effect is that farmers who were initially offered a high price saw greater resale potential and chose to sell the seed rather than plant it,
 suggesting that price signals can divert products from their intended use when resale is feasible.

 shows results for regressions at the county-crop level.
 We find important differences between average seed trial pack use.
 For instance,
 while average seed trial pack use is close to 100 percent in the Uganda case,
 less than 70 percent of Ethiopian farmers used the wheat seed trial pack.

\end_inset

 There are also marked differences in the relative importance of screening,
 sunk cost and signaling effects between countries and crops.
 In Uganda,
 high overall seed trial pack use limits variation in the outcome,
 potentially attenuating the measured effects.
 Results from the pooled regression seem to be primarily driven by teff in Ethiopia,
 for which we also find a significant and negative sunk cost effect,
 implying that paying actually reduces use (conditional on valuation).
 This could be due to liquidity constraints:
 Even among farmers who value the seed similarly,
 those who had to pay for it may have less cash left over for complementary inputs or other production needs,
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Liesbeth:
 How large are the cost of this seed trial pack as compared to other costs that would be needed?
 Is there any reason why this cost/friction caused by the higher price of the seed would be there for teff,
 but not equally well for wheat?
 Just wondering how convincing this argument is.
 Alternatively:
 farmers felt they had paid too much (for teff) and resold to get back the money?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 reducing their ability to plant.
 Rather than reinforcing commitment,
 payment appears to create friction---a finding that challenges conventional wisdom on pricing as a behavioral tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results are quite different if we look at wheat in Ethiopia.
 Here,
 we do find a sizable and significant sunk cost effect,
 in addition to a weak negative screening effect.
 Farmers who paid a positive price for the wheat seed trial pack were more likely to plant it than those who received it for free (keeping their valuation constant).
 This suggests that paying out-of-pocket for the seed increased their psychological commitment to make use of the technology.
 This could be because in Ethiopia,
 wheat is more commercially oriented,
 with clearer market outlets and government-backed productivity programs,
 so paying for seed is more likely to translate into planting.
 Teff markets,
 while important,
 are less tied to formal seed systems,
 and farmers often prefer their own saved seed,
 so purchasing a trial pack does not necessarily increase the likelihood of use.
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Bjorn:
 @gashaw:
 is this a good reason?
 Here are some potential reasons for the observed pattern:
 what do you think best reflects reality?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1.
 Agronomic and market context differ.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Wheat in Ethiopia often benefits from strong market demand,
 established value chains,
 and government support (e.g.,
 price incentives,
 extension programs),
 making it a crop where investing even a small amount can pay off quickly.
 Paying for the seed may reinforce the intention to plant,
 hence the positive sunk cost effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Teff,
 while culturally important,
 has more entrenched traditional seed systems.
 Farmers may already have access to acceptable local seed at low cost,
 so paying for the trial pack may not increase commitment to use it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
2.
 Farmer familiarity with the variety.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If the improved wheat variety was perceived as newer or riskier,
 paying for it could signal personal commitment to test it out properly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For teff,
 familiarity or skepticism about the promoted variety might have led to purchase for reasons other than planting (e.g.,
 curiosity,
 social pressure),
 which could result in lower use despite having paid for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
3.
 Input complementarities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Wheat may require complementary inputs (fertilizer,
 land preparation) that farmers who pay for seed are more likely to invest in,
 boosting the sunk cost effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For teff,
 if complementary inputs are costly or less available,
 even those who pay for the seed might decide not to plant,
 flipping the effect negative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
4.
 Season-specific shocks or constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the wheat season,
 good rainfall or favorable market prices may have made planting more attractive for those who had paid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the teff season,
 unexpected labor shortages,
 price drops,
 or other constraints could have disproportionately affected those who paid for the seed,
 leading to non-use.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another indicator of appropriate use is whether farmers kept the seed separate during planting.
 Planting the seed separately (rather than mixing it with local varieties) reflects a deliberate intention to evaluate the promoted variety on its own merits,
 which may influence adoption decisions in subsequent seasons.
 While the pooled regression in the top panel of Table 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{tab:Effects-on-Use-sep}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 shows no strong effects on this outcome,
 the crop-specific results reveal patterns consistent with those for general seed use:
 a positive sunk cost effect for wheat,
 along with negative sunk cost and signaling effects and some evidence of a positive screening effect for teff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For maize in Uganda,
 none of the coefficients are statistically significant,
 likely because overall,
 94% of farmers kept the seed separate,
 leaving little room for variation from screening,
 sunk cost or signaling effects.
 Similar to the case of planting,
 we also examine whether farmers kept the harvest from the seed trial pack separate.
 Doing so indicates that the varietyâs identity was maintained throughout the season,
 enabling an accurate assessment of its yield and other performance characteristics,
 and thus serves as an additional measure of appropriate use.
 The pooled regressions reveal a significant screening effect,
 driven entirely by teff in Ethiopia.
 For maize in Uganda and teff in Ethiopia,
 we observe negative sunk cost effects,
 whereas for wheat the sunk cost effect is positive.
 As with all use-related outcomes for teff in Ethiopia,
 we also find a negative signaling effect on this measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final indicator of appropriate use concerns who actually planted the seed trial pack.
 The premise is that screening,
 sunk cost,
 and signaling effects may also influence whether the recipient plants the seed personally rather than passing it to someone else.
 Paying for the pack,
 for instance,
 may strengthen the motivation to plant it oneself instead of delegating it to a household member whose farming skills or practices are less certain.
 The results align closely with those for overall seed trial pack use,
 showing a positive screening effect and a negative signaling effect for the pooled regressions---both largely driven by teff in Ethiopia---and a positive sunk cost effect for wheat in Ethiopia.

\begin_layout Standard
All of these patterns are summarized in the indices,
 which reveal a strong and significant screening effect of prices on overall seed trial pack use.
 As with the individual outcomes,
 this effect is driven primarily by teff in Ethiopia.
 However,
 the index also shows that the individually insignificant but consistently positive coefficients of the WTP price across the various dimensions of maize seed trial pack use in Uganda combine to produce a statistically significant overall screening effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judged by the index,
 seed trial packs exhibit negative sunk cost effects:
 after controlling for willingness to pay and signaling effects,
 farmers who received the pack for free made more appropriate use of it---across the combined dimensions in the index---than those who paid a positive price.
 The overall negative sunk cost effect is found for both maize in Uganda and teff in Ethiopia.
 Interestingly,
 for wheat we find the reverse:
 here (positive) sunk cost effects do seem at play.
 The negative sunk cost effects for maize in Uganda and teff in Ethiopia likely reflect liquidity constraints that reduced farmersâ ability to invest in complementary inputs after paying for the seed,
 whereas the positive effect for wheat in Ethiopia suggests that in this more commercially oriented crop,
 the commitment induced by payment outweighed such constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 the coefficient on the initial offer price on the index is only weakly significant in the pooled model.
 Only for teff in Ethiopia,
 a clear negative signaling effect is found for the seed trial pack index.
 The stronger negative signaling effect for teff in Ethiopia may reflect farmersâ preference for their own local seed for this traditional staple crop.
 When the initial offer price is high,
 it may also increase the perceived resale value of the trial pack,
 prompting farmers to sell rather than plant it.
 In contrast,
 wheat is more commercially oriented,
 with stronger market linkages and institutional support,
 so even at high initial offer prices farmers are more likely to interpret the price as a quality signal and plant the seed rather than sell it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Adoption and production in subsequent season
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adoption of the promoted technology in the subsequent season is particularly relevant,
 as seed trial packs are designed not only to encourage initial experimentation but also to foster sustained uptake of the variety.
 Measuring behavior in the following season therefore reveals whether farmersâ trial experiences translate into repeated use and longer-term impacts.
 Further down the causal chain,
 we also examine whether production and productivity of the underlying crop varies with the prices signaled,
 negotiated,
 and ultimately paid.

The second outcome is more specific,
 and asks if the promoted variety (ie.
 the one from the seed trial pack) was planted on the randomly selected plot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that about 22 percent of Ugandan maize farmers used quality seed of improved varieties on the randomly selected plot.
 Focusing specifically on the variety promoted in the study,
 roughly 11 percent planted Bazooka.
 In Ethiopia,
 these shares are substantially higher:
 about 60 percent and 70 percent of farmers reported using improved varieties of teff and wheat
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Liesbeth:
 I was surprised about these numbers,as the baseline descriptives in table 1 indicate that only 19% of Ethiopian farmers in Aug 2022 reported using improved seeds on at least one plot.
 While now (Nov 2024) we see very high shares having planted improved seed on the raondmly seleted plot.
 Has there been a massive roll-out in the meantime?

,
 respectively.
 These differences are mirrored in adoption of the promoted variety,
 with 34 percent for teff and 31 percent for wheat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the pooled regressions,
 we do not find any significant screening,
 sunk cost,
 or signaling effects on adopting any improved variety.
 However,
 when considering adoption of the promoted variety,
 we do find that farmers with a higher willingness to pay are also more likely to have adopted it in the subsequent season,
 an effect driven primarily by teff in Ethiopia.
 This aligns with the earlier findings on seed trial pack use,
 where screening effects for teff also played a central role.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to production (measured in kilogram produced on the randomly selected plot) and productivity (production divided by the area of the randomly selected plot),
 the pooled regression provides suggestive evidence of a screening effect.
 However,
 this time the results seem to be driven by maize in Uganda:
 For each 1000 UGX increase in the valuation of the seed trial pack,
 production in the subsequent year increased by almost 20 kilograms,
 which corresponds to about 5 % over the mean.
 The significant screening effect disappears at the intensive margin (productivity),
 suggesting that farmers with a higher valuation also expand plot size

Liesbeth:
 Not entirely clear to me how they would do that.
 Did you fix the plots?
 they could have planted on more plots,

 not at differences as compared to baseline,

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize these results,
 the index results point to the presence of screening effects in longer-run adoption and production outcomes,
 with the strongest patterns observed for teff in Ethiopia,
 particularly for adoption of the promoted variety.
 Compared to the results for seed trial pack use,
 these effects are less pronounced and statistically less robust,
 which is to be expected given that these outcomes are realized further along the impact pathway,
 where initial price-related mechanisms are likely to weaken as other factors such as seasonal conditions,
 market dynamics,
 and farmersâ evolving situation and preferences play a greater role.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Complementary input use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally,
 we look at screening,
 sunk cost and signaling effects with respect to complementary inputs.
 In particular,
 we check if farmers used fertilizers (organic or inorganic) on the randomly selected plot.
 We also inquire about chemicals (pesticides,
 insecticides,
 and fungicides).
 Complementary inputs are very important for yield benefits of improved seed varieties to materialize,
 a fact that is not always appreciated by farmers,
 especially if a lot of money has already been invested in acquiring the seed

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examining complements may thus help in clarifying mechanisms:
 screening may operate because farmers with a higher WTP are those prepared to deploy the necessary inputs;
 sunk cost may raise or lower complementary investment depending on whether payment increases commitment or tightens liquidity

 It could also be "I've already invested so much in the seed,

 There the liquidity argument would not hold?

;
 and price signals may shift expectations about quality and therefore the optimal intensity of complementary use.
 By tracking complements,
 we can interpret adoption and yield results more accurately and speak to policy design,
 for example whether subsidies should be bundled with input vouchers or guidance rather than applied to seed alone.
\end_layout

In the pooled results,
 reported in the top panel in Table 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{tab:Effects-on-Inputs}
\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 higher willingness to pay is associated with greater use of complementary inputs,
 with a positive screening coefficient the input index.
 This effect seems to be mainly driven by fertilizer use.
 By contrast,
 sunk cost effects are negative for complementary input use:
 Paying for the seed appears to tighten cash and crowd out complementary investment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not find signaling effects in the pooled model.
 Turning to crop specific regressions,
 for the case of maize seed trial packs in Uganda,
 overall use of inputs is moderate (about 55 percent for fertilizer and 29 percent for chemicals).
 Screening effects are positive,
 albeit not significantly so for chemicals.
 Sunk cost effects are negative:
 Farmers who value the seed more invest more in fertilizer,
 but payment reduces their ability to do so,
 consistent with liquidity constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For both teff and wheat in Ethiopia,
 complementary input use is already near universal for fertilizer and high for chemicals,
 reflecting Ethiopiaâs strong government-led input supply system,
 coordinated through centralized procurement and distribution via cooperatives and extension agents.
 Coefficients are small and not statistically significant across mechanisms.
 Only for chemical use for wheat,
 screening effects are positive,
 and sunk cost effects and signaling effects are negative.

\begin_layout Standard
Taken together,
 complementary inputs echo the seed-use story.
 Where there is room to vary management,
 we see positive screening effects and negative sunk cost effects,
 that is,
 selection on willingness to pay and crowd-out from payment;
 where input use is saturated,
 these effects are muted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper,
 we examined how pricing influences the introduction of a new technology,
 using the case of improved seed varieties for teff,
 wheat and maize distributed to smallholder farmers in Ethiopia and Uganda.
 While temporary discounts are often justified as a way to encourage trial of an unfamiliar product or service,
 critics argue that free provision can lead to waste or misuse.
 We tested whether charging a positive price affects use and adoption through three distinct mechanisms.
 First,
 prices may serve as a screening device,
 ensuring that products are allocated to those who value them most.
 Second,
 having paid for a product may foster a sense of commitment,
 since not using it would mean wasting the money spent,
 consistent with the sunk cost rationale in behavioral economics.
 Third,
 goods obtained for free or at a very low price may be perceived as lower quality,
 reducing the effort and care invested in their use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We identified the three mechanisms through a novel field experiment that used a three-stage pricing design.
 In the first stage,
 a product (a seed trial pack) was offered at an initial offer price that may serve as a quality signal.
 In the second stage,
 farmers participated in a bargaining game,
 which revealed their willingness to pay price for the product.
 In the third stage,
 a randomly selected group of farmers received a surprise discount,
 resulting in variation between the final offer and actual transaction price.
 In a regression framework,
 these three prices allowed us to separately estimate the signaling,
 screening,
 and sunk cost effects,
 while controlling for the other mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We test whether each of these three prices affect if and how the seed trial packs were used,
 how prices affected adoption and production in the next season,
 and if price affected investment in complementary inputs.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Berber:
 I'm wondering if we could show how the final offer price influences each of the three outcome variables,
 without controlling for screening and signaling effects,
 as a policy relevant outcome.
 Maybe something we can discuss.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Overall,
 we found that higher willingness to pay is often associated with greater use of seed trial packs,
 adoption of the promoted variety in the following season,
 and in some cases higher production,
 consistent with a screening effect.
 By contrast,
 paying for the seed seldom strengthened commitment to use and in some cases reduced appropriate use or complementary investments,
 potentially due to liquidity constraints.
 Initial high offer prices did not reliably act as positive quality signals and in some instances discouraged planting.
 These patterns were not uniform across settings:
 for wheat in Ethiopia,
 paying a positive price appeared to increase commitment to use,
 while for teff,
 screening effects were more pronounced but high initial prices reduced use,
 likely due to strong preferences for local seed or resale incentives.
 This heterogeneity highlights that the influence of price depends on both crop characteristics and the surrounding market and input supply context.

These findings have several implications for the pricing of seed trial packs in efforts to promote improved agricultural technologies.
 First,
 the consistent evidence of positive screening effects suggests that charging a low,
 symbolic price can help target seed packs to farmers most likely to plant and adopt the promoted varieties.
 However,
 even modest prices can reduce diversion or misuse and improve the cost-effectiveness of distribution programs,
 particularly where resources are limited and follow-up is costly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second,
 the presence of negative sunk cost effects cautions against relying on payment to boost commitment.
 In our setting,
 paying for seed generally did not increase use (except maybe for wheat in Ethiopia) and in some cases reduced appropriate use or investment in complementary inputs,
 likely due to liquidity constraints.
 This suggests that charging higher prices may inadvertently undermine learning and adoption by reducing farmersâ ability to manage the crop effectively.
 Where targeting is needed,
 low prices should be coupled with measures that support access to complementary inputs,
 such as input vouchers or extension advice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third,
 the weakly negative signaling effects indicate that higher initial offer prices are unlikely to serve as reliable indicators of quality and may in some cases discourage planting.
 This risk is greater in contexts where farmers have strong preferences for local seed or where resale markets exist.
 Pricing strategies should therefore avoid inflated or misleading reference prices and instead build trust through clear communication,
 demonstrations,
 or endorsements from credible sources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taken together,
 the results suggested that the most effective approach was to set a modest price that enabled targeting without creating financial barriers,
 while using additional targeting mechanisms beyond price (such as limiting distribution to active farmers,
 using extension agentsâ local knowledge,
 or requiring simple expressions of interest) to ensure seed reached those most likely to use it.
 Our findings also indicated that the effects of pricing may be technology- and context-specific,
 underscoring the need to tailor strategies to the local market,
 crop characteristics,
 and input supply conditions.
 To avoid the negative effects of payment on input use,
 programs should have safeguarded farmersâ ability to invest in complementary inputs,
 for instance by bundling fertilizer or chemicals with the seed trial pack,
 offering small input vouchers,
 or scheduling input credit alongside seed distribution.
 Trust in the product could have been strengthened through non-price signals such as field demonstrations,
 peer testimonials,
 or endorsements from credible local actors.
